# Real-Time Event Ticketing System

This repository contains the code for a real-time event ticketing system. It is organized as a monorepo with three main components:

- **CLI (Java)**: A command-line interface for managing events and tickets.
- **Backend (Node.js)**: A server that handles ticket operations and user interactions.
- **Frontend (Vite + React)**: A web interface for managing and viewing tickets in real time.

## Folder Structure

- `cli/`: Contains the CLI implementation in Java. [Read instructions at (real-time-event-ticketing-system/cli/README.md)]
- `backend/`: Contains the backend implementation using Node.js. [Read instructions at (real-time-event-ticketing-system/backend/README.md)]
- `frontend/`: Contains the frontend implementation using Vite and React. [Read instructions (real-time-event-ticketing-system/frontend/README.md)]
